## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

1. **Start small**: Launch with 20 temples, scale to 500
2. **Test offline**: Disable WiFi while developing
3. **Monitor quotas**: Check Firebase Console daily first week
4. **Use emulators**: Test before using real devices
5. **Commit frequently**: Push code to GitHub multiple times daily
6. **Document decisions**: Write why you chose each approach
